# Internship-Projects
  This are the codes which I had written during my Internship
  1. Lexical Density Code:-
    Lexical Density is all about find the meaningful contents from the text. These lexical words are a combination of noun, verbs,  adjectives and prepositions. Based on the text , we find out the words belonging to the POS-Tag and based on that the lexical density is calculated.
  2. Readability Score Code:-
    Inorder to read any given text, we need to know who exactly can read a particular and from which level. Example:- Rhymes can be read in Nursery Grade and an NaCl can be read by a student of 4-5 Grade. Using Readability Index Score we can find which grade student is fit to read a given text.
  3. Spelling Correction Code:-
    Spelling mistakes in the text are corrected using spellchecker Library
  4. Grammar Correction Code:-
    For doing the grammar correction to particular text I have made use of ginger library.
