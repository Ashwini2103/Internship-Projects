# Internship-Projects
This repository contains the projects done during Internship
  This are the codes which I had written during my Internship
  1. Lexical Density Code:-
    This finds out the content words i.e. the words with meaningful information from the entire text
  2. Readability Score Code:-
    This code finds the readability index of the text or document. Example:- If the text has readability index 12-13 that means
    the students right from grades 12-13 can understand the text properly.
  3. Spelling Correction Code:-
    This code takes the raw text and text is converted to a particular format, thereby spell_checker library is applied on it
  4. Grammar Correction Code:-
    For any given text the grammar correction is done using ginger library.
